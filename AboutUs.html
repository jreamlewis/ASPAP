<p>Alpha Sigma Phi Alpha Rho Chapter was founded at Newark College of Engineering. But it wasn't originally Alpha Sig. In the beginning, we were Phi Delta Zeta who was founded on January 1, 1921. We were the first fraternity established at the Newark College of Engineering. The fraternity began to seek national affiliation in the mid 1920's. With the assistance of Rev. Albert H. Wilson, a Sigma Nu active in the inter-fraternity movement, the fraternity combined with Alpha Kappa Pi of Wagner College on the afternoon of March 23, 1926, in the study of Rev. Albert H. Wilson, forming a new national fraternity. This Fraternity became Alpha Kappa Pi, of which the Newark College chapter became the Alpha Chapter. On May 23, 1926, Alpha Kappa Pi held its first <q>National Convention</q> at the Clendenin Hotel, New York City. The chapter house in the 1930's was at 112 Bleaker Street.</p>
<p>In 1946, with the merger between Alpha Sigma Phi and Alpha Kappa Pi, the chapter was re-chartered as Alpha Rho of Alpha Sigma Phi. The chapter house was at 119 Warren Street. Alpha Rho Chapter became inactive in 1952 due to enrollment declines resulting from the military mobilization for the Korean War.</p>
<p>In 1981 an interest group formed which was colonized on March 21, 1981. Grand Secretary Evin Varner, Presbyterian '58, and Grand Senior President Richard Gibbs, Oklahoma '51, presented the colony certificate. Neale Bedrock, NJIT '82, was a leader of the reactivation effort. The chapter was re-chartered in January 1982. Initiation of the charter members was performed at the Alpha Tau Chapter house. A house at 273 High Street, Newark, was obtained. From 1990 until about 1998 the chapter was located at 184 Warren Street. In the late 1990s the housing corporation purchased a chapter house at 267 Martin Luther King Blvd.</p>
