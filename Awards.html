The Delta Beta Xi Award is given for sustained alumni service to the Fraternity, generally over a period of at least ten years. While potential criteria for the award are as varied as our brotherhood, general criteria include years of service, type of service, and significant achievements. To be inducted as part of a class, a brother must receive at least 2/3 of the points possible from the judges (past Delta Beta Xi recipients) and must be in the top ten among all the nominees for that particular year.
