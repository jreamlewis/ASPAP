<h1>On December 6, 1845, a brotherhood was formed.</h1>

<p>On this cold, bitter, evening at Yale University, our great fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi was founded to unite the standards and principles that three young freshmen sought to preserve through brotherhood. It began with the ideals and ambition of Louis Manigault, a 17-year-old South Carolinian, and his close friends Stephen Ormsby Rhea and Horace Spangler Weiser. Together, these young men created Yale's second Sophomore Society, offering their peers an option in selecting a Fraternity that was better suited to their own ideals. The ideals and principles are wrapped around the five values that we hold dear: Silence, Charity, Purity, Honor, and Patriotism. 
</p>
<p> Throughout its 160+ history, the brothers of Alpha Sigma Phi have kept many of the principles and ideals of our founding fathers while incorporating new principles to fit modern time. These principles and ideal are what connect each chapter and brother all through life. </p>
<p> Alpha Sigma Phi is a Fraternity that holds scholarship in high regard and puts its beliefs into action; a Fraternity that believes in service to its campus and community and strives to find innovative methods to express this concern for others. 
</p>
<p>As the nation's tenth oldest social fraternity and eleventh oldest men's fraternity, Alpha Sigma Phi has endured a long history of both trials and prosperity. Our symbol, the phoenix, aptly describes our way of life in that if we fall, we will rise once more. With these ideals and principles, we have fostered the growth of a brotherhood that now consists of thousands of active brothers and over 70 chapters. With these brothers, we'll embody our motto, <q>The cause is hidden, the results well known.</q>.
